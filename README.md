# ðŸ“· Image Sharing Platform
This is a full-stack web application where users can create accounts, share their favorite images, and explore content shared by others. The platform focuses on simplicity and user experience, allowing people to express themselves visually and connect through pictures.
## ðŸ’» Technologies Used 
### Frontend

- HTML: Used to structure the content and layout of the web application.

- CSS: Provides styling to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive design across different devices.

- JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the user interface, enabling dynamic elements such as form validation, responsive navigation, and real-time updates.

### Backend & Database
- Node.js: A runtime environment that powers the server-side logic of the application. It handles user authentication, routes, file uploads, and communication with the database efficiently using asynchronous programming.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user profiles, image metadata, and post content. It allows flexible schema design and efficient querying for fast data retrieval.

- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the backend API, manage routes, and handle server-side logic efficiently.

- Multer: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used to upload images from the client to the server and store them locally. It enables efficient handling of media files during the post creation process.
